# HEIG-VD DAI Course 2023-2024

Welcome to the
[Développement d'applications internet (DAI) course](https://gaps.heig-vd.ch/consultation/fiches/uv/uv.php?id=6573)
at [HEIG-VD](https://heig-vd.ch), Switzerland!

This course defines the basics of network communication and how all these
communications are programmed.

At the end of the course, you will know how to define, program and deploy
network applications, how to interact with them, and the different elements to
pay attention to make robust applications.

Whether you are in software, security, data science, embedded or network, you
will have to deal with network applications (APIs, devices, etc.). This course
will give you a solid grounding in this world.
